# Yo, how are you doing?

This is the path to my territory. Only enter if you’re aware you’ll be reading a lot of bio… about me.  
Ok, layer 1 entered—be prepared.

## Layer 1

I try a lot of stuff, but I don’t always stick with everything. Flexibility matters, right?  
I *do* stick to the things that are important to me: being expressive, being creative, and being out front.

**In short, I’m into:**
- Computer Science
- IT-Security
- Electrical Engineering  
  *(all of these as a novice student)*
- Music *(recently started guitar & singing; I’m “condemned” to perform at a wedding soon 😅)*
- Sometimes dancing *(Hip-Hop and mixed styles)*
- Tightening the nuts & bolts of some not-very-stable systems

Still learning a lot on the way. Already defeated? No—so let’s move on to Layer 2.

## Layer 2

### Developer Thangs
- Web Dev *(everything JavaScript, full-stack)*
- Operating Systems Dev *(very basic, e.g., a shell clone)*
- Not much more to tell you for now

### IT-SEC Thangs
- Cryptography *(symmetric, asymmetric)*
- Not much more to tell you for now

### Electrical Thangs
- Nothing to tell you for now

### Music
- I can play some chords that sound nice, right?

You should take a closer look at the projects if you’re interested. I’ve recently started taking life seriously (sometimes), so there will be updates in the future.
