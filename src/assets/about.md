# Yo, How are you doing?

This is the path to my territory. Only enter if you are aware that you will be reading a lot of Bio...about me. 
Ok, layer 1 entered, be prepared. 

## Layer 1
I am someone who does trying out a lot of stuff, but a lot of times does not stick to those. Instead I move one since managers nowadays require flexibility right? 
Ok I stick certainly to some things. Things that are important to me. Like being expressive, being creative and I like to be in the front. So in short: Computer Science, IT-Security, Electrical Engineering (all of those as a novice called student), Music (started recently guitar & singing, since I am condemned to perform on a wedding soon), sometimes dancing (Hip-Hop and Mixed stuff) and of course setting the nuts & bolts of some not very stable systems. That is it, still learning a lot on the way. Already defeated? No, so letÂ´s move on to layer 2


## Layer 2
*Developer Thangs*
    - Web-Dev (Everything that comes to JavaScript, Fullstack)
    - Operating Systems Dev (Very Basic like Shell-Clone)
    - Not much to tell you at now

*IT-SEC Thangs*
    - Kryptography (Symetric,Asymetric)
    - Not much to tell you at now

*Electrical Thangs*
    - Nothing to tell you at now

*Music*
    - I can play some chords that sounds nice, right?

You should take a closer look at the projects if you are interested. I recently started taking life seriously sometimes. So there will be some updates in future.
